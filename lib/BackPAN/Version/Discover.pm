BackPAN::Version::Discover - Figure out exactly which dist versions you have installed

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Please note: this module's interface is HIGHLY ALPHA, mainly because I want
input from users on how they think it should work. Therefore, this is all
subject to change, if only you *tell me what you want* :)

    use BackPAN::Version::Discover;
    
    my $bvd = BackPAN::Version::Discover->new();
    
    # exclude relative dirs and anything under $HOME
    my @dirs = grep { ! /^$ENV{HOME}|^[^\/]/ } @INC;
    
    # this may take some time and use lots of ram and/or CPU
    my $results = $bvd->scan( dirs => \@dirs );
    
    # please let me know if the separate results object is good or bad.
    my @releases = $results->release_paths();
    my 

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new BackPAN::Version::Discover object with the given parameters.

Currently ignores all parameters.

=head2 scan

Scans for installed, loadable modules and tries to determine exactly which
CPAN/BackPAN distribution release each may have come from. If the C<dirs>
option is specified, the scan will be restricted to the given array of
directories. Otherwise, it will default to searching all directories
currently specified in @INC.

Options:

=over 4

=item dirs

An arrayref containing the directories to scan.
