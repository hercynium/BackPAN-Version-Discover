This all started out as a script whose code is in original_script.pl

It was turned into a module mostly by cutting and pasting, but I'd
like to keep it around for reference, at least until I'm convinced
that the module is working as expected.


If you want to run a scan and find out what backpan releases
you have installed to your system perl, run example_scan.pl.

It will scan perl's @INC, excluding relative paths and paths
under your $HOME directory, and (hopefully) tell you what
you installed.
