BackPAN-Version-Discover

This module can be used to discover exactly which versions
of which cpan distributions you have installed, and give
you the path to those tarball releases on the backpan.

Note: this module is by no means a perfect solution. It makes
some educated guesses and some assumptions to try and figure
out exactly what you have installed.

Vendor-packages modules are a particularly odd case, since
many will be modified, and the maintainers may or may not
have updated the version numbers. However, most of the time,
they will at least install these modules to a separate set
of lib dirs that is designated by the perl binary as being
the place for them. By default, the scan this module performs
skips over those modules.

However, on debian-based systems, you can find out what
packages you have installed that contain perl modules 
installed under @INC using this shell snippet:

find `perl -e 'print join " ",@INC'` -name '*.pm' 2>/dev/null \
    | xargs dpkg -S 2>/dev/null | sed 's/:.*$//' | sort -u
